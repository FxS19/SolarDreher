# SolarDreher
A Atmel ATtiny 85 based device with only on purpose. Keep the attatched wind chme rotating.

It is build of:
* A old CD drive motor
* Attiny 85
* 17F of super cap condensators (5.5V)
* 40ma 5V solar panels
* a red led
* a green led
* son other circuits to limit chargig voltage and limit voltage for the leds

# Features
* Monitor and display charging voltage
* Keep the speed nearly equal at diferent voltages
* Some safety featrures if components fail
* Run 24/7 in summer
* Never shut down in winter (only microcontroller)
